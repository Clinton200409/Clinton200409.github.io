         <strong> Website Purpose</Strong><br>
         <p> Hello, my name is Clinton Ijifisoye and this is a website that I am making using the HTML language that I have been learning in my Csc class.<br>
         In this website, you will be able to follow different things about my computer science journey.<br>
         Creating this website will assist me in being more understanding in using HTML and CSS.<br>
         I will be including different things on this website like things about me and things that I have done in the class.<br>
         I hope to learn more and more about these 2 languages and to create my own website with my own ideas in the near future!<br> </p>
