         <strong> Something About Clinton</Strong><br>
         <p> My name is Clinton Ijifisoye and I am taking this computer science course because I am pursing a computer science degree at the University of Rhode Island.<br>
         This is my index.html code. I'm from Providence Rhode Island and have lived there for over 14 years.<br>
         I am currently using Github to create my first ever website using HTML code and have learned a significant amount about it.<br>
         Currently, I want to learn and hopefully master different coding languages and to become a software programmer after I graduate from URI!<br> </p>
